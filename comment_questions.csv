Just to check -- does your example still not reproduce the issue if the package is installed in editable mode? (i.e: `pip install -e ./app`) For me the issue only reproduces when the package is installed in editable mode.

The requirement for any gevent + asyncio solution to work well is that gevent runs in one thread, and asyncio runs in another thread. You can't have gevent and asyncio running on the same physical thread because then one loop would block the other.

What's happening when you run the example above is that the monkey patching prevents asgiref from launching a separate asyncio thread. It thinks it is launching a new thread, but due to the monkey patching it is launching a greenlet instead. So then the asyncio loop ends up running in the same physical thread as gevent, and this is bad even without the error messages.

I was actually able to get your example to run without errors only by commenting out the logic that raises the `RuntimeError` in asgiref. But this only masks the issue, it does not remove it. The correct solution would be for asgiref to somehow identify that it is running under a monkey patched gevent and figure out how to access the original unpatched threading module to launch a physical thread."

I actually stripped asgiref out for a simple `threading.Thread` in `Flask.async_to_sync` to simplify things, and the problem still occurs. I was hoping to find some way to write `async_to_sync` using Gevent, but it doesn't seem possible with how asyncio and threads work. Tried asyncio-gevent `async_to_sync` as well, but it just freezes with concurrent requests. I also tried `gevent.monkey.patch_all(threading=False)`, but that fails as well."

In my opinion this needs to be investigated to be sure that it is true in all cases. A simple async view function that just sleeps works, but a view function that does real async work could have interference from monkey-patched stuff in the standard library. For example, will you be able to launch a subprocess or use the process executor from the async function? Probably not, because `subprocess` is monkey-patched by gevent. Same for anything dealing with sockets or anything else that gevent monkey-patches and asyncio expects to be unpatched.

As I said above, after I commented out the `RuntimeError` in asgiref, your example runs cleanly for me. Asgiref by default runs only one asyncio thread for all the calls to `async_to_sync`, so under monkey-patching I see it create a single async loop inside a single greenlet. So at a high-level, this is all good, if you ignore that you now have a gevent loop and an asyncio loop competing with each other inside the same thread."

I have an updated theory of why this appears to work well. Both loops are still running in the same physical thread, but the asyncio loop is using a monkey-patched selector in its scheduler, so that allows it to coexist with the gevent scheduler, with both working cooperatively, and both using greenlet-based non-blocking waits."

This does appear to work with standard asyncio, but it hangs with uvloop. Below is a short demo. If you comment out the monkey patching, then the coroutine runs fine and you can Ctrl-C it.

```python

uvloop.install()
loop = uvloop.loop.Loop()

threading.Thread(target=loop.run_forever).start()

The algorithm I was hoping to implement was Filippo's recommended appraoch:

1. Allow safe methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS)
2. If Origin in trusted list → allow
3. If Sec-Fetch-Site present:
   - same-origin or none → allow
   - same-site or cross-site → REJECT
4. If neither header present → allow (not a browser)
5. If Origin host == Host → allow, else reject

Based on this.

**What gets rejected:**

- Browser requests where Sec-Fetch-Site is cross-site or same-site
- Browser requests where Origin is present but doesn't match Host (old browsers)

**What gets allowed:**

- Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin (browser, same origin)
- Sec-Fetch-Site: none (browser, user-initiated like bookmarks)
- No Sec-Fetch-Site + no Origin (not a browser — API clients)
- No Sec-Fetch-Site + Origin matches Host (old browser, same origin)
- Any request to a trusted origin in CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS 

So default-on should not break APIs at all. The protection only kicks in when browser-specific headers are present and indicate a cross-origin request.

Does this address your concern, or am I missing an edge case?"
pallets/flask,https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5863,https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5863#issuecomment-3661305957,2025-12-16T16:08:00+00:00,"@davidism Here's how I was thinking of implementing this.

**Option 1: Flask + Werkzeug implementation**

1. Accept csrf as a parameter to `@app.route | @blueprint.route` but will still be in `**options` kwargs
2. `werkzeug.routing.Rule` [class](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/a9f6b3c7924912e62ea74f39f10fb611d6e7725e/src/werkzeug/routing/rules.py#L459-L473) to have the argument `csrf` and attribute `csrf` 
3. In `flask.App.full_dispatch_request`, call `self.check_csrf(ctx.request)` after `request_started.send` and before `self.preprocess_request` 

https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/2579ce9f18e67ec3213c6eceb5240310ccd46af8/src/flask/app.py#L1001-L1002

**Option 2: Flask only implementation**

1. Same as above
2. Instead of adding argument to `werkzeug.routing.Rule`, just set `rule_obj.csrf = options.get(""csrf"")` similar to how `provide_automatic_options` is set.
3. Same as above 

https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/2579ce9f18e67ec3213c6eceb5240310ccd46af8/src/flask/sansio/app.py#L647-L648

---

**On exempt paths:** This approach avoids the ""separate map of exempt paths"" problem entirely. Since `csrf` is stored on the `Rule` object itself, we just check `request.url_rule.csrf` at dispatch time requiring no separate data structure to sync.

**On `TRUSTED_HOSTS` vs origins:** You're right, they're different. So I'd keep them separate:

- `TRUSTED_HOSTS`: existing, for [Host header validation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#flask.Request.trusted_hosts)
- `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`: new, full origins for cross-origin allowlist (OAuth callbacks, etc.)

**On Werkzeug vs Flask:** I lean toward Option 2 (Flask only) since:
- The check logic references Flask's `app.config` for `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
- It follows the `provide_automatic_options` precedent
- Werkzeug stays transport-layer focused

The core check logic (~40 lines) could still live in Werkzeug as a utility function that Flask calls, if you want other frameworks to benefit. But the routing integration feels Flask-specific.

Want me to put together a draft PR for Option 2?"

We want to upgrade an overridden method that does not take the new `ctx: AppContext` parameter. We can detect this in `__init_subclass__` with `inspect.signature`, and wrap the function to take the correct signature, so that other parts of the dispatch code will call it correctly. But that's the ""simple"" part.

What if other user code is still calling the method, overridden or not, without the new argument? The most obvious way this happens is with `super().method` within the overridden method. The wrapper could perhaps be clever enough to check the type of the first argument, and decide to make a new or old signature call. The wrapper would have to be applied to every base method to handle the `super` call case.

I haven't tried to write this more complex wrapper yet. I have a feeling it will be difficult to write. I know it will add overhead to every request, since multiple methods will now have to do detection on the arguments passed to them. This overhead will mostly be waste, as the vast majority of code will not be overridden.

Perhaps we can just say this is a breaking change in 4.0? I still think the result is worth it. We could still show a better error message by doing some detection in `__init_subclass__`, but showing an error instead of applying a wrapper and showing a warning."

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/reqcontext/#teardown-callbacks here ? It's not immediately obvious to me that they could run more than once, but even then this isn't the original issue we encountered, because our teardown callbacks are indeed idempotent — the `g.pop()` was used here to exhibit the issue.

My issue was more around *when* it can be called: in this specific case, even before entering the generator passed to `stream_with_context()`. I wouldn't expect a teardown callback to be called at this point, considering `do_teardown_request()` is « Called after the request is dispatched and the response is returned »."

Thanks for finding the PR that affected it, when I took another look at this it put me on the right path.

The problem is related to how we automatically push an app context when pushing a request context. If an app context is not already pushed, we create one and push it, recording that we should pop it when the request context is popped. We store this using `ContextVars`, which are sensitive to the async loop/thread they were modified from. The order that pushes and pops happens in is important, and is pretty complex when dealing with the request/response, stream with context, and test client context preservation all at once.

The immediate issue you reported is because of when `stream_with_context` was pushing the request. It would push it as soon as the generator started, and in the case of an async view it is running in a temporary async loop context only for that view function. Therefore, when we went to pop it later during cleanup and test client, the context it was pushed in no longer matched the current context.

That can be fixed by adjusting when the context is pushed to when the streaming response starts, rather than when the generator starts. But this resulted in another error, because at that point the app context had already been cleaned up, but recorded for client preservation. So the generator would automatically push a new app context, then things would get cleaned up in the wrong order.

That can be fixed by pushing the app and request contexts separately in `stream_with_context`, so that the request context will not automatically add or clean up the app context.

There's a comment in `stream_with_context` saying that pushing at the point it was is intentional and required for correct operation. But as far as I can tell with further test scenarios, everything works correctly with the change. Perhaps it was required before that PR changed how things worked.

Specificially for `redirect`, that's what it returns. `flask.Response` is a subclass, meaning it's not valid in that typing context. This is in general impossible to solve, we've gone back and forth before and it causes issues in user code no matter whether we use Flask's or Werkzeug's `Response` in our own annotations."

Hi! 👋 I'm new to contributing to Flask and really interested in getting involved in the project.
This issue looks like something I could help with and learn from — would it be okay if I took it on?

I'm not entirely sure whether this suggestion aligns with Flask’s design philosophy and consistency with similar decorators. If it's confirmed that this is a change the team would consider, I’d love to help implement it.

Could I be assigned as the assignee for this issue?

Thanks!"

I'm keen to start contributing to Flask and this issue caught my eye. It seems like a great way for me to get familiar with the project.
If addressing this decorator behavior fits the team's vision for Flask's design, I'd be happy to take it on. Could I get assigned?

Thanks!"
