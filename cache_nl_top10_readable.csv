5,"Memory consumption spikes when an api endpoint with file upload capability is hit. I have an API application, created using connexion framework, which uses FlaskApp configuration. This app exposes an endpoint where users/consumers can upload artifacts(ranging from 2.5 MB to 400 MB) and they will be then upload to an internal storage platform. The pain point is, when the user selects a larger data file(~320 MB) to upload, the application often runs into OOM issue and eventually user receives 502 status response. Running dmesg command inside containers show the gunicorn thread being killed by oom_killer It would be of great help if someone here could guide in avoiding such OOM issues for Flask Applications.

5,"Memory consumption spikes when an api endpoint with file upload capability is hit. I have an API application, created using connexion framework, which uses FlaskApp configuration. This app exposes an endpoint where users/consumers can upload artifacts(ranging from 2.5 MB to 400 MB) and they will be then upload to an internal storage platform. The pain point is, when the user selects a larger data file(~320 MB) to upload, the application often runs into OOM issue and eventually user receives 502 status response. Running dmesg command inside containers show the gunicorn thread being killed by oom_killer It would be of great help if someone here could guide in avoiding such OOM issues for Flask Applications.

Renovate scans for outdated dependencies and opens pull requests with suggested upgrades — saving time and helping us keep things secure and up to date. To get started, we’d just need to install the Renovate GitHub App. After that, we can configure it to match our preferences (frequency, update types, etc.). I’m happy to help with the initial setup and submit a configuration PR if the team is open to trying it out. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Thanks, Liora You’re right. I messed this up. I shouldn’t have said “we” since I’m not part of the project. That was a bad call. And I thought I understood your post, but I clearly got it wrong. I didn’t mean to ignore what you said, I just misunderstood it. Also, just to be transparent: I use AI to help me write in English, because it’s not my first language and I want to express things clearly. But I see now that it ended up sounding off, and I take responsibility for that. I wasn’t trying to be fake or talk down to you. I just wanted to suggest something that might help, but I get that it didn’t come across well. I’ll step back. Thanks for all the work you do.

37,"Clarify semantics of app context Thanks for building Flask! I'm one of the maintainers of https://github.com/google/mesop which is a Python UI framework built on Flask. Mesop uses g to maintain request-specific context (essentially the UI data for the current request), see call site example I read through the Flask docs and am not 100% sure whether this is an appropriate use of g. From https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.g:  This is a good place to store resources during a request. For example, a before_request function could load a user object from a session id, then set g.user to be used in the view function.  This makes it sound like g is suitable as I'm trying to store information about the current request.  From https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/appcontext/:  Flask automatically pushes an application context when handling a request  This suggests that an application context is always created inside the scope of a request. However, https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.ctx.AppContext states:  An app context is created and pushed at the beginning of each request if one is not already active  This seems to suggest an application context is not always created inside the scope of a request. These two docs seem to contradict one another (or perhaps I'm mis-reading it). Any clarification would be helpful.  One of the complexities with our use case is that other developers are building on top of Mesop and could create app contexts, and I want to make sure that when I'm binding a value to g, it's to a local-specific app context and not some more global app context that persists across requests.",9,0.6614675521850586,0.6614675521850586,flask,RequestContext,,d:\499\src\flask-3.1.2\flask-3.1.2\src\flask\ctx.py,715a991d5fe825b518d951270a4d8c14473662b2,

In my case of a web server for controlling Raspberry Pi cameras raspiCamSrv, there are several threads under control of the web app, like live stream, video recording, etc. These threads use the Picamera2 library which starts its own threads. This is normally not an issue because these threads are started by users from the Web UI after the Flask server has started. Now, I have added a motion capture feature, which is also running in an own thread and users want this feature to be automatically started with the server, for example after the device has been rebooted. Currently, I start this thread in the app factory create_app(). And, as in #5307, the thread is started again when I start Flask with the --debug option. I do not seem to have the possibility from my own code to detect whether these threads are already active. The classes from which these threads are started and which hold their references, seem to be initialized again, although they are singletons. Question I am not considering this as a bug.

I do not seem to have the possibility from my own code to detect whether these threads are already active. The classes from which these threads are started and which hold their references, seem to be initialized again, although they are singletons. Question I am not considering this as a bug. My question is whether there is a possibility in create_app(), to know that the app is being recreated on behalf of the autoloader.

48,"How to avoid duplicate threads in debug mode Issue Description I have a similar issue as #5307 and I also understand the arguments related to threads in web applications. In my case of a web server for controlling Raspberry Pi cameras raspiCamSrv, there are several threads under control of the web app, like live stream, video recording, etc. These threads use the Picamera2 library which starts its own threads. This is normally not an issue because these threads are started by users from the Web UI after the Flask server has started. Now, I have added a motion capture feature, which is also running in an own thread and users want this feature to be automatically started with the server, for example after the device has been rebooted. Currently, I start this thread in the app factory create_app(). And, as in #5307, the thread is started again when I start Flask with the --debug option.
