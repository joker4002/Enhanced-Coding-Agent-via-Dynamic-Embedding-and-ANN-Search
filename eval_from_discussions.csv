pallets/flask,5862.0,https://github.com/orgs/pallets/discussions/5862,"Proposal: CLI command to validate API endpoints by making test requests Motivation When working on Flask applications with many API endpoints, it is sometimes useful to quickly check whether all registered routes can be accessed without raising unexpected errors (e.g. unhandled exceptions, 500 errors). At the moment, developers typically need to write custom scripts or tests to perform this kind of basic validation. Providing an opt-in CLI command could help improve developer experience, especially during local development. Proposal Introduce an optional Flask CLI command (for example, flask check-endpoints) that iterates over registered routes and makes test requests using Flask’s test client. The goal would not be full correctness testing, but a lightweight sanity check to detect obvious runtime errors. Possible initial scope:  Only routes with simple methods (e.g. GET by default) Skip routes with required path parameters Report endpoints that raise exceptions or return 5xx responses Development-only usage  Design considerations  The command should be fully opt-in and not affect existing behavior. No network requests; use Flask’s built-in test client. Keep output simple and readable (similar to flask routes). Advanced features (custom payloads, auth, etc.) could be out of scope initially.  Open questions  Should this live as a core CLI command or as an optional extension? How should endpoints with required parameters or authentication be handled? Should the command fail on the first error or report all failures?  Feedback on the general direction and scope would be appreciated before starting an implementation.",think|you|could|easily|create|standalone|package|integrates|the|flask|cli|via|entrypoint|jyup|escape|already|created|and|like|discuss

I checked the Flask doc about file upload: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/fileuploads/ There I found this:  So how exactly does Flask handle uploads? Well it will store them in the webserver’s memory if the files are reasonably small, otherwise in a temporary location (as returned by tempfile.gettempdir()). But how do you specify the maximum file size after which an upload is aborted? By default Flask will happily accept file uploads with an unlimited amount of memory, but you can limit that by setting the MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH config key:  I didn't see a way to specify the threshold that Flask uses to decide whether to use a ""temporary location"" instead of memory. Not sure this is really helpful, sorry.  What I'm looking for is recommendations on better implementation to avoid spike in Memory consumption.",Request._get_file_stream|yesminehe|fix|issues|large|file|uploads|set|app|config|and|override|_get_file_stream|use|disk|based|chunks|shutil|copyfileobj|data

The second that I close one of the tabs, requests start flowing again and all the old pending ones fire instantly. This doesn't occur when opening multiple tabs in different browsers, or when opening another tab in Incognito, only when it's on the same browser. How I handle sessions Session are created on user login - if(correct_login): #Correct login.     session[""username""] = username     session[""last_modified""] = datetime.now()  I have a before_app_request hook that checks session validity with each request. Every user initiated request also updates last_modified with session[""last_modified""] = datetime.now(). Other then that some routes use session data like the username in their process. All session are stored in a Redis instance. However this issue still persists when using another method like Filesystem. Is my approach to sessions wrong? Is this a known issue with sessions and I should consider another tool?

Hot Module Replacement has been existed in JavaScript ecosystem for a long time, but Python web applications are still using full reloads by default. To solve this situation, I implemented the hmr package, which does the fine-grained dependency tracking, on-demand reloading jobs. Here is a demo of what the results look like:                    flask.mov                   Obviously the a.py runs everytime in flask run --reload but reloads only when needed in hmr app.py. But everything else works fine (at least for this small demo) You may say that user should use lazy imports and cache expensive calculations themselves, but in fact not every function can be cached, and lazy imports may lead to ugly code style. This can be solved with on-demand hot reloading without overhead. So I believe this is the future. Although this is just a minimal demo, but I value hmr's potential in the Python ecosystem, and believe that with our efforts this is a reachable goal.

Despite configuring the Flask application with Flask-CORS and ensuring headers are sent from the client, the server consistently logs the received SECRET_KEY as None, resulting in a 403 Invalid SECRET_KEY response. I have tried multiple debugging approaches, but the issue persists. Below is the detailed information about the setup, code, and error logs. Environment: Operating System: Windows 10 Python Version: 3.11 Flask Version: 2.2.5 Flask-CORS Version: 3.0.10 dotenv Version: 1.0.0 Reproduction Steps: Set up the .env file in the project root directory with the following content: API_SECRET_KEY=mflow1546 Run the following Flask application: import os from flask import Flask, request, jsonify from flask_cors import CORS import logging from dotenv import load_dotenv Load .env file load_dotenv() Get SECRET_KEY from environment variables SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('API_SECRET_KEY', 'default_key') if not SECRET_KEY or SECRET_KEY == 'default_key': print(f""Loaded SECRET_KEY from environment: {SECRET_KEY}"") raise ValueError(""SECRET_KEY is not properly set."")

Actual Behavior: The SECRET_KEY received by the server is always None (as logged by the Received SECRET_KEY log). The server consistently responds with a 403 Invalid SECRET_KEY error. Debugging Steps Tried: Verified the .env file is correctly loaded (the correct SECRET_KEY is printed at startup). Ensured the headers in Postman and PowerShell are set properly. Logged all headers received by the Flask server (custom headers like SECRET_KEY are not present). Used Flask-CORS with allow_headers=[""Content-Type"", ""SECRET_KEY""].

pallets/flask,5534.0,https://github.com/orgs/pallets/discussions/5534,"Concurrent Request Processing Issue in Flask with Gunicorn and Gevent-Websocket on AWS Hi everyone, I hope you're doing well. I'm currently working on a Flask project where I'm utilizing flask_login, flask_sqlalchemy, and flask_socketio. The application is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Gunicorn . web: gunicorn --worker-class geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker -w 1 --timeout 340 --graceful-timeout 340 application:application I'm encountering an issue with request processing: when an I/O(database) operation is performed in one http request, other HTTP requests remain in the queue. According to the Flask-SocketIO documentation, increasing the -w (worker count) parameter beyond 1 is not suggested. Despite the application being load balanced , requests still get stuck in the queue. I understand that Flask operates as a WSGI server, but I am seeking a solution to enable concurrent request processing. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or guidance on how to address this issue. Thank you!",miguelgrinberg|the|documentation|increasing|worker|count|parameter|beyond|not|suggested|don|understand|how|related|problem|are|using|gevent|concurrency|happens
pallets/flask,5533.0,https://github.com/orgs/pallets/discussions/5533,"Flask using bytes instead of str during SecureCookieSessionInterface.save_session Hi everyone, I'm currently working with the latest versions of Flask, Werkzeug, and itsdangerous on Python 3.11.9 and encountered a TypeError related to string vs bytes where string is required for werkzeug. Here are the versions I am using: Flask==3.0.3 Flask-Login==0.6.3 itsdangerous==2.2.0 Werkzeug==3.0.3 Issue: When calling self.get_signing_serializer(app).dumps(dict(session)) [source: github], it returns a bytes object. Feeding this bytes value into response.set_cookie results in the following TypeError: TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object Details:  get_signing_serializer returns URLSafeTimedSerializer, which is part of itsdangerous.  URLSafeTimedSerializer.dumps() returns bytes.   werkzeug==3.0.3 seems to expect string values for cookies starting from version 3.0.0. If you remove the # type: ignore[union-attr] comment, you should see that types are not handled correctly.  Steps Taken: Tried various combinations of Flask and itsdangerous versions to work with Werkzeug 3.0.3 but couldn't resolve the bytes issue. Using Werkzeug 3.0.3 is necessary due to security vulnerabilities in earlier versions.

pallets/flask,5507.0,https://github.com/orgs/pallets/discussions/5507,"Clarify semantics of app context Thanks for building Flask! I'm one of the maintainers of https://github.com/google/mesop which is a Python UI framework built on Flask. Mesop uses g to maintain request-specific context (essentially the UI data for the current request), see call site example I read through the Flask docs and am not 100% sure whether this is an appropriate use of g. From https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.g:  This is a good place to store resources during a request. For example, a before_request function could load a user object from a session id, then set g.user to be used in the view function.  This makes it sound like g is suitable as I'm trying to store information about the current request.  From https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/appcontext/:  Flask automatically pushes an application context when handling a request  This suggests that an application context is always created inside the scope of a request. However, https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.ctx.AppContext states:  An app context is created and pushed at the beginning of each request if one is not already active  This seems to suggest an application context is not always created inside the scope of a request. These two docs seem to contradict one another (or perhaps I'm mis-reading it). Any clarification would be helpful.  One of the complexities with our use case is that other developers are building on top of Mesop and could create app contexts, and I want to make sure that when I'm binding a value to g, it's to a local-specific app context and not some more global app context that persists across requests.",davidism|makes|sound|like|suitable|trying|store|information|about|the|current|request|appropriate|place|per|data|extensions|recommend|using|prefix

Hello, Recently I found a problem with Django and submitted a patch in a PR: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35309 django/django#17984 I also developped a work-around for old versions of Django: https://github.com/LLyaudet/django-monkey-patches/blob/main/src/django_monkey_patches/django__orm__prefetch_without_useless_order_by.py I don't know yet Flask details. The idea is just that some models can have a default ordering (I assume this functionality is present in Flask also). And that some ORM may still add this ordering in the SQL query whilst it is not needed because only a single object will be prefetched per instance of the original result set. On very big prefetches I noticed a gain of 10 - 15 %, since the rest of the DB query is mainly an index scan. #ClimateChangeBrake Can someone please dump the queries of such prefetches and see if the bug is present in Flask ? If so submitting a PR should not be too hard. I will try to help.

In my case of a web server for controlling Raspberry Pi cameras raspiCamSrv, there are several threads under control of the web app, like live stream, video recording, etc. These threads use the Picamera2 library which starts its own threads. This is normally not an issue because these threads are started by users from the Web UI after the Flask server has started. Now, I have added a motion capture feature, which is also running in an own thread and users want this feature to be automatically started with the server, for example after the device has been rebooted. Currently, I start this thread in the app factory create_app(). And, as in #5307, the thread is started again when I start Flask with the --debug option. I do not seem to have the possibility from my own code to detect whether these threads are already active. The classes from which these threads are started and which hold their references, seem to be initialized again, although they are singletons. Question I am not considering this as a bug. My question is whether there is a possibility in create_app(), to know that the app is being recreated on behalf of the autoloader.
